                          Critical minerals are fast becoming what oil and gas were to the last century—indispensable to economic security, strategic autonomy, and technological progress. In an era of global transitions—from clean energy to advanced manufacturing—the race to secure reliable access to these minerals has intensified. India, too, has recognized this strategic imperative.

                        <p>
                          With the launch of the Critical Minerals Mission, rising exploration activity, and a growing number of auctions and procurement efforts, India is laying the groundwork for long-term mineral security. Simultaneously, geopolitical shifts and tightening export controls have exposed the fragility of global supply chains.

                          The <strong>Critical Minerals Dashboard</strong> by Ananta is a first-of-its-kind platform that offers a sector-wise, data-driven view of India’s critical mineral landscape. It brings together mineral intelligence and policy insight to help decision-makers, researchers, and industry leaders understand:

                        <ul>
                          <li>Which minerals matter most for which sectors</li>
                          <li>Where the vulnerabilities lie</li>
                          <li>What strategies can build resilient and diversified supply chains</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                          All infographics and visual tools on the dashboard have been created in-house, with an emphasis on mapping mineral dependencies and supply chain risks. This dashboard aims to be a resource for strategic foresight, informed policy, and collaborative solutions.
