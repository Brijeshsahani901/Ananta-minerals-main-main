                          REEs are processed by IREL, but the country has no

                          hydrometallurgical leaching, this pilot has
                          demonstrated vanadium recovery rates above 85%,

                          with countries and firms that have de-risked advanced
                          mineral processing. Collaboration with Japanese seabed
                          mining research, U.S. REE chromatographic separation
                          platforms, or EU-funded substitution chemistries in
                          semiconductors would enable India to leapfrog legacy
                          inefficiencies.

                          If these measures are enacted, India could reduce
                          import dependency for key defence and semiconductor
                          minerals. More importantly, it would signal India's
                          emergence not just as a consumer of advanced
                          technologies but as a co-creator in the global
                          strategic materials ecosystem.
