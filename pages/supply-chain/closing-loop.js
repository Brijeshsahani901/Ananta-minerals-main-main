                          The robustness and resilience of India's clean energy
                          supply chains depend heavily on how efficiently the
                          country can recover and reintegrate critical minerals
                          from end-of-life (EOL) batteries. As the adoption of
                          electric vehicles (EVs) and stationary storage
                          accelerates, domestic access to secondary sources of
                          lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and graphite
                          becomes increasingly strategic for securing raw
                          material supply and reducing import dependency.

                          A sound battery recycling industry forms a domestic,
                          secondary source of strategic minerals, potentially
                          reducing India's reliance on volatile and
                          geopolitically sensitive international mining supply
                          chains. It enables localized, circular supply loops
                          where recovered materials are reintegrated into
                          battery or material production, reducing the pressure
                          on primary extraction. At present, however, India's
                          battery recycling sector remains nascent and
                          structurally disconnected from its larger battery
                          manufacturing ecosystem. While global lithium prices
                          have softened and commodity markets show signs of
                          temporary oversupply, long-term supply security
                          remains uncertain. In this context, a robust domestic
                          recycling value chain can serve as a critical buffer
                          against future supply disruptions and price
                          volatility.

                        <p className="my-3">
                          To strengthen India's battery recycling supply chain,
                          a multipronged approach is essential. First,
                          investments must be directed toward expanding
                          reverse-logistics infrastructure and developing formal
                          recycling hubs to shift collection away from the
                          informal sector and into certified, traceable systems.
                          Second, incentive structures should be extended to
                          cover recycling activities, including viability-gap
                          funding to support the processing of all battery
                          chemistriesâ€”particularly low-value typesâ€”and the
                          introduction of mandates requiring minimum recycled
                          content in new batteries. Finally, establishing a
                          dedicated national agency to oversee battery
                          circularity and supply chain integration can ensure
                          better coordination, streamlined regulation, and the
                          seamless incorporation of recovered minerals into
                          domestic battery manufacturing pipelines.
